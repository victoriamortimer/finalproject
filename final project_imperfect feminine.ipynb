    "# For weeks, I had this idea in my mind that I wanted my final project to be related to love. \n",
    "It could be in any form, I just had to find the right data set\n",
    "Also, recently I became obsessed with this media outlet called The Pudding that produces visual data-based stories -- and after investigating\n",
    "their website I found a data set that would be perfect for me: Billboard's Top 100 list\n",
    "Due to a trend they saw on social media where people were addressing the apparent 'death of the love song'\n",
    "what they did was ask a question to the data: Is the love song dying?\n",

    "Last week, I got my Spotify Wrapped and while I was not surprised at all with the result, I was a bit disappointed: in the end, it seems like\n",
    "I'm just a girl after all. Lana del Rey, Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift, and obviously the brat-summer queen, Charli XCX\n",

    "trend, which coincided a lot with my Spotify results. \n",
    "\n",
    "So I decided to take the same data set The Pudding used but to analyze another possible trend: When did the 'imperfect feminine' movement in music start?\n",
    "And is it an actual trend after all? How did popular taste in music change over the decades?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step was downloading the .csv file with the Billboard data and cleaning and organizing the database - then, I had to decide how to analize which were the top songs of the year?\n",
    "What was the methodology I was going to use. \n",
    "1. First, I would select the top 10 songs per month\n",
    "2. Secondly, I would combine the top 10 songs of every month and, depending how many weeks each of them spent on the top 10, I would choose the Top 10 of the year\n",
    "3. Clasify songs per genre\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, I used a mix of hand-work & Chat GPT\n",
    "- first I sorted the data chronologically by hand, then prompted ChatGPT to sort the data from most popular songs to least based on the amount of weeks each song spent on the top of the chart\n",
    "\n",
    "- and when I got the data sorted out, I decided to upload it to jupyter and start asking some questions\n"
